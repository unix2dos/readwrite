How unfortunate that a woman who has been trafficked is forced to bear children and a lock around her neck. If there's anything more unfortunate than that, it's the matter that it's become taboo to talk about it.

We would rather concentrate on the athletes in the Winter Olympics than on the woman around us who suffer injustice. If the lock around a woman's neck has no connection to you and me, what connection does the medal around a champion's neck have to us?

Ordinary people make up the majority of modern society. Ordinary people's fates are more likely to overlap with ours than celebrity's fates. We can't truly feel unless it happens to us.

We are easy to be believed and easy to be forgotten. We are frequently awakened and trapped again. We are still live in Plato's cave, and the shadow in the darkness isn't the entirety of this world.
