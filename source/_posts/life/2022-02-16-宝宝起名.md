The ancients said that give a child a good name better than give him a thousand gold.

I have recently seen a lot of new baby names on Douyin, with a lot of likes and comments. Like the names in romance novels(e.g., "左柚", "宋屿安", "但子昂").

I feel that the name of a romance novel will be popular by the next generation of parents, but it is best not to take the kind of the name of GuoJingMing novel "<Fantasy City\>".

Each historical stage has its popular name. The first two years were "子轩", "子涵", "诗涵", "梓涵", Before that, it was "建国", "抗美", "援朝".

I like the names of the Republic of China and Pre-Qin eras. The names in ci of Chu and The Book of poetry also seem to be popular and cultural.

I think a very earthy and vulgar name is also a good name, the name hidden in the sea of people can better protect us.
