After four official statements were issued to the locked woman in Fengxian, the masses still questioned the identity of the woman. Yesterday, Jiangsu Province had to issue a new statement to investigate, from Fengxian to Xuzhou and then to Jiangsu, What makes it so difficult to deal with? It takes longer to debunk a lie with another lie than to discover the truth.

"We know they're lying, they know they're lying, they know we know they're lying, and we know they know we know they're lying, but they're still lying," says one remark circulating on the internet. Isn't this a ridiculous situation?

The credibility that is no longer believed can still fulfill its political role, even if it seems flawed. Everyone receives what they want via it, then it is still functional and well-functioning, which is the true nature of ideology. In some ways, this type of ideology is much more terrifying because it is no longer the deliberate lying of a few, there is an open lie that everyone tacitly defends together.

Naked lies no longer serve as dream generators but are still allow each individual to continue to live in a fictitious world where everyone is pretending to sleep. From another perspective, we believe we are rescuing the locked woman, in reality, she is rescuing us.
