I sometimes ask myself whether I like boys or girls. I feel like I have risen to the philosophical level that it's both great. 

I found Xuan, consciously or unconsciously, reveals that she likes boys. Although she didn't say it clearly, I can read her heart. So I also kind of hope it's a boy because I don't want to see the downcast of Xuan. 

Boys can always accompany themselves to old age. But don't drift away from home as I did; it will make me feel that boys can't accompany us forever.
