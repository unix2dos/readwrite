I believe I am a tool seeker to the extreme, particularly when it comes to recording things. I have tried many note-taking tools and they are called divine artifacts. such as 'Notion', 'Obsidian','Roam Research'.

Then I realized I was wasting too much time on learning tools, and after rethinking, I decided to give up the note form and return to the note source. It is better to quietly write a note than to pursue a perfect note-taking tool.

I take notes when I study and write down my daily life. Is it meaningful to do so? It makes sense to me that it is using the output to force input.

If I don't do anything for an entire day, there will be nothing to remember, and I will realize I need to do something. Taking notes will help me in remembering what I accomplished during the day and will serve as a reminder to quit doing nothing every day.
